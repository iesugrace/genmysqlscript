When compile MySQL server from source, we don't have a service control script like the RPM version, with this script, we can make one in a minute. The script created by this script works for MySQL server version 5.6.14 and 5.1.71 on RHEL 6.3 and RHEL 6.5, other versions may work, but not guaranteed.
